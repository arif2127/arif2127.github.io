## About Me

I am an AI and Computer Vision Engineer at OPIN INC., South Korea, specializing in deep learning solutions for industrial automation. My work primarily focuses on developing robust and scalable APIs for defect detection, object detection, semantic segmentation, and anomaly detection. Additionally, I have expertise in camera calibration, object alignment, and image enhancement.

I completed my MS and Ph.D. combined program in Computer Science and Engineering from Kyung Hee University, South Korea. My research interests include 3D reconstruction, video processing, semantic segmentation, and deep learning techniques applied to real-world problems.
